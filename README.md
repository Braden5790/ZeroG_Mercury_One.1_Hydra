# ZeroG_Mercury_One.1_Hydra
Welcome to the configuration repository for my **Ender 5 Pro** that I converted to a **ZeroG Mercury One.1 Hydra 3D Printer**! This repository contains all the configuration files, macros, and scripts needed to run my custom setup powered by [Klipper firmware](https://www.klipper3d.org/).

The folder titled **Printer_Klipper_Configs** contains all of the configuration files that I am currently running on my 3D Printer.

## Contents

- `printer.cfg`: Main configuration file for the printer.
- `macros.cfg`: Custom macros to enhance functionality.

## Features
